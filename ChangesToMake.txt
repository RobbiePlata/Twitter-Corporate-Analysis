			--CHANGES TO BE MADE--

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

		1-CHANGING SEARCH PARAMTERS
	
	When searching we want to make the following changes
		! Only search for english tweets, the list of paramters for the search funtion can be found here https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets
			(it still seems like we are pulling non-english tweets into our raw file.)
			(rather than researching we will just delete these by hand while labeling, they are very sparse)
		! Only pull tweets that contain at least one word
			(i.e. no tweets are only emojis, links, and @someones)
			(similarly, we will delete these by hand in the files we have already pulled)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		2-CREATING NEW FILE OF FILTERED TWEETS 

	In filtered_tweets we want to copy raw_tweets with the following changes.
			*** We will have to slim down the characters we allow in as the input tweet will now be 2D rather than 1D which is more exclusive ***
		* change ---G---, ---N---, or ---B--- on the last line to be 100 010 and 001 respectivly, these labels should go on the line right below the tweet they correspond to
		* Change the filter function so that it takes a raw_tweet file and converts the strings stored int he raw file into a new filtered_tweet file.
		! change "@" to "at" when it isnt part of @someone
		! "&amp" should be changed to "and"
		! ":" and ";" should be changed to a space
		! "-" and "_" should changed to a space
		! remove the characters * and "
		! change all punctuation to periods
		! every comma should be converted into a space
		! When there is more than one @someone in a row, we only want to store one SOMONE
			(so @person1@person2 @person3 @Wendys @person4@person5,   will be converted to SOMEONE COMPANY SOMONE)

	The goal of this filtering is to have all tweets be made entirly of alphabet characters, sapces, periods, and apostraphys
	If any other chacters are present in the tweets, the filtering processes should be amended accordingly

		3-PARSING THE TWEETS TO INPUT DATA
	
	We need to take what we have in the filtered tweet file and normalize it to doubles between 0.0 and 1.0
		* Chnage input to 2D binary representation of the tweet, i.e. a = [0, 0, 0, 1], b = [0, 0, 1, 0]
		* All characters will be treated as lower case
		* Each tweet will be stored as a list of doubles where each letter will be trasnformed by the function 
			n = { ((int) letter.toLower() - 95) / 27 if letter \in {a, b, c, . . ., z}
			  = {  0                                 if letter = space or period
		* Each list should then be stored in a dict with its corresponding 1-hot lable of [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] or [0, 0, 1]
		* Possibly store all these converted numbers into a textfile called inputdata.txt

		4-CHANGES TO THE MODEL
	
		* Try L1,2 norm to get more spaces kernels
		* Change model from 1D to 2D with a trivial second dimension, kernels should respond better
			- will have to change demensionality of falttened tensors
		* Finish writing new optomizer
		* Create proper feed-dict for new 1-hot lables
